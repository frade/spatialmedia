# Spatial Media Metadata Injector for Linux

A tool for manipulating metadata in MP4 and MOV files.
It can be used to inject spatial media metadata into a file or validate metadata
in an existing file.

I'm using the tool to inject 360 metadata into a video file editied in Davinci Resolve before an upload on Youtube.

## Usage

[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) must be used to run the tool.
From within the directory:

#### Run a GUI

    python3 gui.py
